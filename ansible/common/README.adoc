= RHACM Ansible playbooks

Playbooks and roles to:

 - Deploy and undeploy RHACM operator and its resources.
 - Import second cluster of DO480 lab
 - Delete MultiClusterHub
 - Delete RHACM Operator
 - Create ManagedClusterSet



The objective is having automations for Dynolabs scripts.

== Configuration of the Playbooks

 * All needed variables are referenced in the file `vars/main.yaml`.

 * Login to different clusters are made with `oc login` to avoid fetching different kubeconfig files from utility. Every playbook needs to log in, but you need to do a log out from Dynolabs.


== List of playbooks


[cols="2*", options="header"]
|===
|Playbook
|Description


|`acm_install`
|Installs ACM operator in `open-cluster-management` namespace, and waits for its deployments to be ready. Uses `kubeconfig` from 'utility' server


|`acm_create_multiclusterhub`
|Instantiates a `MultiClusterHub`, the object that creates ACM console, resources and management hub. Waits for the object to be in phase `Running` (up to 20 minutes). Uses Secret `pull-secret` from the namespace `openshift-config`


|`acm_import_cluster2`
| Imports cluster `ocp4-mng.example.com` to ACM. It set label vendor=OpenShift to it, to add Observability addon

|`acm_add_observability`
| Add Observability resources needed for hub cluster and for all managed clusters.It cheks readiness of its deployments)

|`acm_create_managedclusterset`
| Add a managed cluster set readin 2 vars that must be provided from Dynolabs:
`managed_cluster_set` and `clusterset_member`


|`acm_remove_observability`
| Remove Observability resources. Not cheking deletion



|`acm_remove_multiclusterhub`
| Deletes MultiClusterHub object and waits to complete deletion. First it tries to dettach second cluster

|`acm_remove`
| Remove the ACM Operator and all its objects. This playbook try to delete MCH WITHOUT previous dettaching of cluster2

== Install ACM and import cluster
In the actual status of this playbooks, you can invoke all the playbooks following instructions from

https://github.com/RedHatTraining/rht-labs-core/blob/master/docs/training/07_AnsibleLabScript.adoc

There is an example in this repo in `$DO480/classroom/grading/src/do480/features-review.py`

|===

 * Dettach a cluster means delete all resources in managed cluster,mainly `open-cluster-management-agent` and `open-cluster-management-agent-addon` namespaces and all its resources

 * When you delete MultiClusterHub the managed cluster `local_cluster` is implicitly dettached

== Dettach Cluster and Uninstall ACM

```
cd $REPO/research/ansible && \
ansible-playbook -vv acm_remove_multiclusterhub.yaml && \
ansible-playbook -vv acm_remove.yaml

```
In case you had not imported the second cluster, you can avoid first command and just run

```
cd $REPO/research/ansible && \
ansible-playbook -vv acm_remove.yaml
```
